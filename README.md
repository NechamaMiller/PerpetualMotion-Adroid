# PerpetualMotion-Android
Perpetual Motion is a game based on the following rules: The game consists of four stacks of cards, each of which starts with one card. The user can only see the top card in the pile at any point in the game. On each turn, the user will have the choice to discard the top card of 2 stacks, discard the top card of 1 stack, or deal again. In order to discard the top card of 2 stacks, both cards must have the same rank. For example, one can be a 5 of diamonds and the other can be a 5 of clubs. In order to discard the top card of 1 stack, that card must have the same suit and a lower rank than another top card. For example, if there is a 3 of spades and a 4 of spades, the user can choose to discard the 3 of spades. In this game, ace equals 1 and jack, queen, and king all equal 10. For example if there is a jack on top of one pile and a ten on top of another, both cards can be discarded. If there are no other moves, the user can choose to deal again, which will put a new card on the top of each stack. If the user finishes the cards in the deck and in all the stacks, he wins. Otherwise, he loses.
